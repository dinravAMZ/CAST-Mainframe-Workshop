# Useful Tools

### Built-in Reports

CAST Imaging has predefined reports that can be used to extract technical knowledge on the application structure.
Access the reports menu by clicking *Reports* in the left hand menu bar.

The available reports are listed below and are available in CSV, XLSX and JSON file formats.

Let's take an example: for the ***Recipe*** application, we're interested in knowing which are the most central artifacts in the codebase. In the ***Reports*** pop-up, we can choose the ***REFERENCES*** section and click on the ***XLSX*** download button.

CAST Imaging will indicate that the report is being generated, and once it's ready, the download will start automatically. The wealth of information that can be collected from those reports is quite significant.

### Advanced search

Within CAST Imaging there is the ability to run ad-hoc queries against the CAST Imaging internal database. 

Cypher Queries can be accessed through the *Search* menu on the *CYPHER* tab. Using Cypher queries requires knowledge on the Neo4j DBMS and its query language.
