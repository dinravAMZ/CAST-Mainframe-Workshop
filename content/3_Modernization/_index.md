# Modernization Workshop

You will now go through three modernization scenarios:

- Scenario 1 – you will identify which would be the best candidates to start the modernization wave

- Scenario 2 – you will consider modernizing a COBOL application by exposing relevant shared functions

- Scenario 3 – you will study the transformation of a distributed Java-Cobol application by identifying best candidates to modularize.
