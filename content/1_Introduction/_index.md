# Accelerate and Secure Mainframe App Modernization with CAST Imaging 

## How to modernize Mainframe applications 

Many organizations today rely on business-critical applications originating decades ago that have become difficult to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the business. The all too common loss of technical and functional knowledge further exacerbates the problem. 

Thus, many enterprises are challenged with modernizing their mainframe applications, but do not know where to start and what their options are.

Learn how CAST Imaging helps: 
* Select the relevant modernization strategy and outline the iterations 
* Outline the mainframe transformation journey 
* Optimize applications continuously post-modernization. 

### Typical paths for mainframe modernization

## Determine the strategy based on objective metrics before migrating to AWS  
CAST Imaging provides automated architecture maps, cloud blockers and structural quality insights at single **application level** and at **portfolio level**, generating a living knowledge base of applications inner workings and interactions. CAST covers a comprehensive range of technologies for IBM Z, non-IBM legacy and AS/400 technologies and distributed technologies around them – 50+ languages, 12+ databases, 100s of frameworks.

* CAST Imaging can be leveraged for a comprehensive analysis of large mainframe portfolio which helps select the eligible modernization path for each appplication, the incompatibilities with emulation / conversion pathways, even the most complex/least documented: 
	* Technology inventory with volume and complexity helping evaluate the **Transformation Readiness** and migration difficulty (Server-side Programs, IBM MQ, Data structures that need to be shared, CICS Transient Data Queues) 
	* Adherence map between applications to help identify cluster of application to be migrated together, number of incoming / outgoing calls and amount / complexity of objects called by other applications, **required refactoring/rewrite** in System interactions 

* CAST Imaging at single application level helps complete the technical inventory and knowledge base before transformation/conversion and evaluate:  
	* **Database Migration Readiness** to migrate non-compatible databases to PaaS native services 
	* Level of isolation of technical layer or vertical transactions to **decouple the monolith**

### CAST Imaging provides adherence map and application metrics to accelerate the waves definition 

Use CAST imaging to accurately select applications to be grouped together for migration. Groupings are automatically defined in CAST Imaging to help choose the relevant POC and quick wins based on the technologies, type of dependencies and application metrics.

## Modernize post migration to AWS 

Thanks to accurate and up-to-date blueprints in CAST Imaging with layers composition and adherences, transactions/data call graphs, inventory of utilities and 3rd-party tools invoked, database/file storages types, code components size and complexity: 

* Post-conversion or emulation, accelerate application discovery and knowledge acquisition on the new code, document and optimize  
* Accelerate planning for further modernization on cloud: monolith fragmentation, encapsulation, segmenting in micro-services, replacement of legacy technologies, or any other modernization scenarios 
* Avoid U-turns during transformation and visualize the impact of changes 
* Accelerate implementation of enhancements and leverage cloud-native services, introduce APIs to “liberate the data” 
* Ramp up resources faster, gain confidence on application and language (Cobol and Jobol – i.e., Cobol converted into Java)  

### Accelerated discovery with CAST Imaging from high-level layers composition down to the source code

## Optimize Continuously  

Leverage CAST Imaging blueprints and structural quality insights to optimize applications post initial and subsequent increments, to help: 
* Preserve knowledge release after release, rely less on few (at risk) resources 
* Detect newly introduced flaws and give feedback to the team, to ensure “next gen will not become the new legacy” 
* Monitor Tech Debt density, identify optimization opportunities using CAST Imaging structural quality insightsc(e.g., MIPS reduction) 
* Engage into more complex modernization paths: fragment monolith to macro/microservices, Move from custom middleware to cloud-native fully-managed services, Move data to cloud-native databases
