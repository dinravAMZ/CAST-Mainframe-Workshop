# Workshop Wrap-up 

## What did we learn 

* CAST Imaging can support Mainframe Portfolio Migration and Mainframe Modernization by providing in a few clicks visibility on the system architecture. 
* Technical documentation based on the actual application source code can be created, saved, updated and shared through interactive graphs and custom comments and tags.  
* Dependencies between applications of the Mainframe system are visible to help build the best wave plan. 
* CAST Imaging helps understand which source code components need to be investigated/changed as part of the transformation tasks and which call paths will need to be tested.  
* CAST Imaging pinpoints the structural flaws residing in each component which helps optimize the Mainframe Application while on AWS 
* CAST Imaging proposes several extraction formats (images, metadata into CSV, Excel, JSON).
